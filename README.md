## Introduction

`Brake Pedal` is a general purpose throttling and rate limiting library. The code was forked from https://github.com/emmekappa/BrakePedal. 

The core library provides the following features:

- Throttling: limit `X attempts` over `Y time period`.
- Locking: after `X attempts` over `Y time period` block future attempts for `Z time period`.

### What's with the name?

The main purpose of this library is to "throttle". "Throttle" as a library name would be too generic. "Throttle" is also commonly used to refer to a car's gas pedal. However, "Gas Pedal" generally means increasing the speed, but this library is trying to limit speeds. "Brake Pedal" better denotes the purpose of the library. 

Sticking to the whole car analogy, maybe calling it "Cops" or "Police" would make more sense since the police would stop you if you go over the speed limit (throttling) and arrest you disallowing you to drive (locking)..?

If you'd like to suggest a name change, feel free to open a PR.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Let's assume we want to throttle login attempts. 

1. Start with a throttle policy:

        var loginPolicy = new ThrottlePolicy()     // An empty constructor uses an in-memory repository
        {
            Name = "Login Attempts",                // Give it a name so it can be used for logging purposes.
            Prefixes = new[] { "login:attempts" },  // Use prefixes to differentiate tracked keys for this policy from others.
                                                    // It might make sense to get rid of this property and just use the Name property. 
                                                
            // Set the limits for this policy. 
            // We want to limit logins to 1 per second and 4 per minute.
            PerSecond = 1,
            PerMinute = 4
        };

2. You can also configure the policy to block requests for a predetermined amount of time:

        var loginPolicyWithLocking = new ThrottlePolicy() 
        {
            Name = "Login Attempts Locking",
            Prefixes = new[] { "login:attempts:locking" }, 
                                                
            Limiters = new Limiter[]
            {
                new Limiter()
                    .Limit(10)                        // Limit 10 requests,
                    .Over(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15))     // over a 15 minute period,
                    .LockFor(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15))  // disallow new requests for 15 minutes
                                                        // from when the initial limits are hit
            }
        };
                
Once instantiated, the policies can be used as follows:

1. Create a key that can uniquely identify the requester. This is used to track the number of requests made:

        var key = new SimpleThrottleKey("username");   // Determine a key to track the requester like user name
                                                       // or user ID or IP address etc or a combination of values.

2. Login policy with throttling only:

        var check = loginPolicy.Check(key); // NOTE: by default, calling the check method will increment the counter.
                                            // If you want to check the status of a policy but not increment the counter
                                            // pass in false to the increment parameter as follows.
                                            // loginPolicy.Check(key, increment = false); 
        
        if (check.IsThrottled)
        {
            throw new Exception($"Requests throttled. Maximum allowed { check.Limiter.Count } per { check.Limiter.Period }.");
        }

3. Login policy with locking:

        var check = loginPolicyWithLocking.Check(key);  
        
        if (check.IsLocked)
        {
            throw new Exception($"Requests blocked for { check.Limiter.LockDuration }. Maximum allowed { check.Limiter.Count } per { check.Limiter.Period }.");
        }
    
### Redis Storage

An in-memory repository (using `System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache`) ships with the main package. The `BrakePedal.Redis` package ships with a Redis repository using [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis).

The `ThrottlePolicy` constructor accepts an `IThrottleRepository`. To use Redis as storage:
    
    var configurationOptions = new ConfigurationOptions
    {
        AbortOnConnectFail = false
    };
    configurationOptions.EndPoints.Add("redishost", 6379);
    var connection = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(configurationOptions);
    var redisDatabaseIndex = 2;
    var database = connection.GetDatabase(2);
    
    var repository = new RedisThrottleRepository(database);
    
    var apiRequestPolicy = new HttpThrottlePolicy<IpRequestKey>(repository) // Pass in the Redis repository
    {
        Name = "Requests",
        Prefixes = new[] { "requests" },
    
        PerSecond = 50 // Only allow 50 requests per second per IP
    };
